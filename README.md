# Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to collect data from the web (Flipkart) using web scraping techniques and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to extract actionable insights.
The workflow covers:

* Data collection from a live website.
* Cleaning and preprocessing.
* Visualization of patterns and trends.
* Generating business-ready insights.

# Technologies Used

* Python 3
* BeautifulSoup & Requests – for web scraping.
* Pandas – for data cleaning & manipulation.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization.
* Jupyter Notebook – for interactive development.
# Data Collection Process

1. Targeted Flipkart product pages.
2. Extracted:

   * Product Name
   * Ratings
   * Inverter Type
   * Stabilizer Type
   * Warranty
   * Price
3. Stored data in structured **Pandas DataFrame** format.
# EDA & Visualization

Performed the following:

* Data Cleaning → handled missing values, corrected data types.
* Univariate Analysis → pie charts, histograms for single-variable distributions.
* Bivariate Analysis → scatter plots, bar plots to compare variables.
* Actionable Insights → interpreted trends for decision-making.
 # Key Insights

* Most products belong to a few top inverter types.
* Higher-rated products often come with longer warranty periods.
* Certain price ranges dominate the market share.
* Stabilizer and inverter combinations impact product pricing.
# Future Improvements

* Automate scraping with pagination & error handling.
* Store scraped data in CSV/Database for reuse.
* Deploy dashboard for real-time visualization.



I can also prepare a **`requirements.txt`** for your repo so it’s complete for GitHub.
Do you want me to create that now?
